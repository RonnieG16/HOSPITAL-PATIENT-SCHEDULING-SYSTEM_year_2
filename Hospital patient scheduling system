Hospital Patient Scheduling System
What is it all about?
This application enables patients to book appointments with hospitals based on proximity and medical department needs. It streamlines the scheduling process, reduces delays, and ensures efficient allocation of medical resources.
Current Business Processes
Phone Booking: Patients call hospital reception to inquire about available slots.
Manual Tracking: Staff uses paper or spreadsheets to manage doctor schedules.
Limited Availability Insight: Patients lack real-time access to doctor availability.
Delayed Confirmation: Appointments are confirmed via follow-up calls or emails.
Problem Statement
The current way hospitals handle appointments is slow and confusing. Patients often get double-booked, can't see which doctors are free, and wait a long time for confirmation. This causes frustration and wastes time for both patients and staff.

Existing Electronic Systems.
Yes, most hospitals use an Electronic Hospital Management System (EHMS).

What does it majorly do?
	Stores patient records
	Manages appointments and queues
	Tracks lab tests and prescriptions
	Handles billing and insurance
	Controls inventory
	Generates reports for administration

Major Clients
Patients: Primary users booking appointments.
Doctors & Nurses: Internal users managing schedules.
Administrative Staff: Oversee operations and confirmations.
Insurance Companies: Process claims and billing.
Government Health Authorities: Monitor compliance and reporting.

Collaborating Agencies
	Ministry of Health / Public Health Departments
	Insurance Companies / National Health Insurance Schemes
	Medical Schools & Universities
	Laboratories & Diagnostic Centers
	Emergency Services
	International Health Bodies (WHO, Red Cross, NGOs)

Contribution to Data Management:
To improve data management:
	Implement centralized database with controlled access.
	Enable real-time updates for appointments and doctor availability.
	Integrate with insurance and government systems.
	Use data backup and recovery protocols.
	Apply encryption and role-based access control.
	Automate reporting for decision-making.

Proposed Business Processes of the System:
The Hospital Patient Scheduling System will automate and streamline the way hospitals manage appointments, doctor availability, and patient interactions. Below are the key processes the system will handle:
1. Patient Registration
•	Patients create an account by entering personal details such as name, contact information, date of birth, and insurance provider.
•	The system validates the data and stores it securely in the database.

2. Doctor Profile Management
•	Doctors register and update their profiles with specialization, department, working hours, and availability.
•	Hospital administrators can assign doctors to departments and update their schedules.

3. Appointment Booking
•	Patients log in to view available doctors by department, location, and time slots.
•	They select a doctor and book an appointment based on availability.
•	The system prevents double bookings and confirms the appointment instantly

4. Real-Time Availability Tracking
•	Doctors update their availability daily or weekly.
•	The system displays real-time availability to patients and staff.
•	Any changes trigger automatic updates across the platform.

5. Appointment Confirmation & Notifications
•	Once booked, the system sends confirmation via SMS or email to the patient.
•	Reminders are sent 24 hours before the appointment.
•	Doctors receive a daily schedule of upcoming appointments.

6. Reporting & Analytics
•	The system generates reports on appointment trends, doctor workload, patient visits, and cancellations.
•	These reports help hospital management make data-driven decisions.

7. Data Sharing & Collaboration
•	The system integrates with government health databases, insurance companies, and emergency services.
•	It allows secure sharing of patient data when authorized.

8. Security & Audit Trail
•	All actions (bookings, cancellations, updates) are logged.
•	Role-based access ensures only authorized users can view or edit sensitive data.
•	Data encryption protects patient privacy.


The Entities and their Relationships 
Entity	Attributes
Patient	Patient ID (PK), Name, CheckInTime, Checkout Time, Phone, Address, Email
Doctor	Doctor ID (PK), Name, Specialization, Phone, Email, Department ID (FK)
Department	Department ID (PK), Name, Location
Appointment	Appointment ID (PK), Date, Time, Location, Department ID (FK), Doctor ID (FK), Patient ID (FK)

Rules
	A patient can be treated by multiple doctors  (1:M)
	A doctor treats one to many patients. (1:M)
	A patient can make one or many appointments. (1:M)
	An appointment can be made by only one patient. (1:1) 
	A department can have one to many doctors. (1:M)
	A doctor can only belong to one department. (1:1)
	A hospital can have one or many departments. (1:M)  
	Patients should be uniquely identified by Patient ID. 
	Appointments can be scheduled according to the nearest location of the patient to the nearest hospital.
	The system can have a set limit for the number of appointments a specific doctor can have in a day. This will help to ensure order and reduce work over load for the doctors.
